In this repo you will find the resources from a workshop that I made for my teammates on [Colba](https://www.linkedin.com/company/colba-technologies-s-l/) about [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with the .NET framework [Chilicream](https://chillicream.com/).

The session was composed on two parts:
1. Introduction to GQL:
   - Origins.
   - Differencies between REST and GQL.
   - Basic introduction to the language
2. Hands on coding.
